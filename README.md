# CSES problem set solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), which Iâ€™m working through as practice while reading [*Guide to Competitive Programming*](https://a.co/d/becTpe3) by Antti Laaksonen.

## Structure

- Each problem has its own file, and all solutions are organized into folders by problem set topics.  
- A base template `_template.js` is included, which handles reading from `stdin` and is suitable for direct submission to CSES.

## Goals

- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Improve speed and accuracy in competitive programming.
- Apply techniques from the book to real problems.
